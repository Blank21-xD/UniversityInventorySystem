Hello! This is Safal Lama.

The core goal of this project is to build an functional University Inventory System. It uses 
Polymorphism, Data Encapsulation, Inheritance, and other OOP functions. 

By creating this project, it has helped to gain an understanding regarding the usage of OOP
in a real world scenario and has helped to develop as a coder. 

I learnt about abstract and how to use it, Inheritance through multiple classes,
how access modifiers such as "protected" and "private" is used, how data encapsulation is used 
via getters and setters with also getting the chance to see how polymorphism is used. I also 
learnt about Error Handling when different things are breached. 

Overall this project helped to gain an deeper knowledge about OOP programming language 
(in this case: JAVA).

This has been my journey so far..
